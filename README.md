To evaluate antibody quality,we propose the novel Antibody Efficiency Estimation from 
             Immunoprecipitation data (AEEIP) model. It contains a maximum a posterior (MAP) estimate
             the efficiency of antibody. It is able to calculate the proportion of mixed Input
             sample in IP sample. It also try to change the hyper parameter of beat prior to
             get the better result.Please don't hesitate to contact <Haozhe.Wang17@student.xjtlu.edu.cn> 
             if you have any questions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of AEEIP from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("whz991026/AEEIP")
```

## Example

The example can be found in vignette
